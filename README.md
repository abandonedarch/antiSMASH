Overview

antismash4.py is a script designed to parse and extract biosynthetic gene cluster information from antiSMASH 4 results in GenBank (GBK) file format. The script reads .gbk files generated by antiSMASH 4, extracts relevant cluster data, and saves the results in a CSV file. It also includes auxiliary classes for managing amino acid counters, data buffering, and processing directories.

Features

Parses .gbk files for biosynthetic gene cluster information.

Extracts cluster type, predicted structures, SMILES, and molecular formulas.

Saves extracted data into a CSV file.

Provides functionalities for analyzing amino acid clusters and managing buffered output.

Requirements

Python 3.x

Biopython (Bio) for parsing GBK files

To install Biopython, you can use:

pip install biopython

Usage

Set Up the Environment

Ensure that Python 3 and Biopython are installed.

Download antismash4.py and place it in your working directory.

Prepare Input Files

Place the .gbk files from antiSMASH 4 in a directory. Update the path to this directory in the script (antismash_results_dir variable).

Run the Script

Update the antismash_results_dir variable to the path where your .gbk files are located.

Run the script using the following command:

python antismash4.py

Output

The script will generate a CSV file (extracted_structures.csv) with the following fields:

Cluster number

Cluster type

Predicted structure

SMILES

Molecular formula
